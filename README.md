Brainwave Internship Projects 
Sales Data Analysis and Demand Forecasting

This project involves analyzing sales data from a commercial store, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning the data, and applying predictive analytics techniques such as demand forecasting. The project also includes visualizations to help stakeholders understand sales trends and actionable insights.

Project Overview

Objectives

Understand and explore the sales data through EDA.

Clean the data for accurate analysis and modeling.

Forecast future sales demand using statistical and machine learning techniques.

Provide actionable insights through visualizations and summary reports.

Dataset Description

The dataset contains sales records from a commercial store. The key fields include:

Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.

Date: Transaction date.

Store_Location: Location of the store.

Category: Product category.

Units_Sold: Number of units sold.

Unit_Price: Price per unit.

Total_Sale_Amount: Total revenue for the transaction.

Payment_Method: Payment method used.

Customer_Age_Group: Age group of the customer.

Discount_Applied: Discount applied to the transaction.

Steps and Analysis

1. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.

Converted the "Date" column to datetime format.

Verified data types for all columns.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized sales trends by date, category, and location.

Identified top-performing categories and locations.

Analyzed the impact of discounts on sales volume.

3. Demand Forecasting

Methodology

Used ARIMA for time-series forecasting to predict future demand based on historical sales data.

Separated training and testing datasets for model validation.

Output

Generated a separate dataset containing forecasted demand values for the next 30 days.

Visualized the actual vs. predicted sales values along with confidence intervals.

4. Insights and Recommendations

Analyzed customer behavior by age group and payment method.

Suggested optimal discount rates to maximize sales.

Highlighted key trends for inventory management and restocking.

Key Deliverables

Cleaned Dataset: Ready for analysis and modeling.

EDA Reports: Includes visualizations and insights.

Demand Forecasting Model: Time-series predictions using ARIMA.

Forecast Dataset: Separate file containing predicted demand values.

Visualizations: Sales trends, category performance, and forecast charts.
